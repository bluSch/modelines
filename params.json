{"name":"Modelines","tagline":"Modelines for sublime text","body":"Modelines for Sublime Text \r\n=========\r\n\r\nCurrently in development.\r\n\r\nModelines for sublime text will provide modeline support for Sublime Text compatible with Vim<sup>1</sup>, and later Emacs. I'm also considering parsing hashbang lines to determine filetype.\r\n\r\nMy desire for this plugin comes from one specific file I deal with very frequently and so might be a bit of an overreaction. That file, the Vagrantfile, is used by [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), and has no extension but is a ruby file. Other files that I can see benefiting from proper modeline support would include template files or other files with nonsensical or nonexistant extensions.\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup>The vim support is based on vim's source and as such will provide support for for ex, vi, and elvis syntax in addition to vim's).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
